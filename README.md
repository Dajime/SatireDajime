  <p style="font-family:'Open Sans Condensed',sans-serif;font-size: 400 px; letter-spacing:inherit;">What do you think when you first hear the word 'hypocrisy'? Hypocrisy is when one claims to have beliefs and standards, to which one's behavior does not conform. You can see hypocrites all around you and all you have to do is pay attention. I become irritated, when I see a doctor smoking, a dentist with rotten teeth, or a policeman who is also a criminal. Another good example is the Roman Catholic Church which is the biggest religious organization in the country. 
</p>
<br>

<p style="font-family:'Open Sans Condensed',sans-serif;font-size: 400 px; letter-spacing:inherit;"> <img src="http://www.mjlegel.com/Blog/2012/poltoons/02/0213ptoons/0002.jpg" alt="Many Church officials interfere with the choiices of the masses." style="float: right;"> The Roman Catholic Church or the Church has been part of the Filipino sociopolitical structure since the Spanish Colonial Era. The Church continues to influence our daily lives and even meddle with affairs of the state. The Church is also popular for its involvement with other non-spiritual and non-religious matters such as family planning. It feels a little intruding but oftentimes it is annoying. It can be irritating if you are not a Catholic and if you see that some of the people who represent the Church is not upholding the standards of integrity that they preach. </p>

<br>

<p style="font-family:'Open Sans Condensed',sans-serif;font-size: 400 px; letter-spacing:inherit;">           How can we bring back integrity and credibility to the people who run the Roman Catholic Church? I propose a multi-step long term solution to bring back the people's trust on the Church's officials. Earning a personâ€™s trust is not easy once it is broken. The process takes a long time and it takes commitment and perseverance to rebuild a broken trust.
</p>

<br>

<p style="font-family:'Open Sans Condensed',sans-serif;font-size: 400 px; letter-spacing:inherit;"> <img src="http://www.cartoonistgroup.com/properties/anderson/art_images/cg54447d29ca428.jpg" alt="This just comes to show how hypocritical they are towards their own sayings." style="float:left;">            The first solution is that the government should conduct a thorough investigation of the scandals that are plaguing the system of the Church. The government should include in the investigative committee people outside of the Church for the investigation to be credible. The investigation should not only be thorough but also transparent. This would mean the investigation would leave nothing unchecked, and the information should be open to all. This also leaves us with the second step: all officials who were found guilty should be made accountable for their actions. The minimum sanction should be removal from their position and other pastoral responsibilities. Another possible sanction will be to make the erring church officials work in missionaries to poverty stricken places so that they understand what service and vocation is all about. The sanction would effectively discourage people of the Church to go corrupt. Third, develop a code of conduct for church workers so that the people become vigilant and empowered to correct erring Church officials. This would encourage people to report Church officials that the government have not yet picked up on. This provides a good defense against the illegal acts that they could do. Fourth, teach the seminarians about the flawed history of the Roman Catholic Church. We educate so that they learn of the past transgressions of the Roman Catholic Church. Unless they learn from history, future church workers will keep repeating the same mistakes. </p>

<p style="font-family:'Open Sans Condensed',sans-serif;font-size: 400 px; letter-spacing:inherit;">           However, this only covers future Church officials. This also begs the question: What do we do with the corrupt Church leaders? The proposal not only needs a solution for the future, but a solution for the present. Where will they go and what will they do? 

 </p>

 <br> 
 
 <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans Condensed', sans-serif; font-size: 400 px; letter-spacing:inherit;">          I suggest we use the arrested Church officials and be used for experimentation. In our search for the untarnished truth and for the sake of science, we could experiment on them and learn about the human body even more than we do now. Not only that, but we could also use for cheap labor and manual work which the supply in the Philippine is declining. We could improve the economic status of the Philippines in a snap. 


 </p>
 
 <br>
 
 <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans Condensed', sans-serif; font-size: 400 px; letter-spacing:inherit;">            These solutions offer no disadvantages or drawbacks to any single part of the people of the Philippines. These solutions provide only benefits which are very easy to understand from even a normal person's viewpoint. The first of these benefits include enjoying cheap labor for the cost of nothing. It doesn't cost anything to give money to the arrested officials. We get to revel in new infrastructure and facilities, with paying the workers at the back of our minds. Second, having them work as cheap labor provides us with no need to procure a lot of money to house them in a prison. If this proposal follows through (which I am sure it will), released Church officials, who are banned from engaging with the Church, could be found almost everywhere, trying to get a job but can't seem to do so because they have little to no education in every field of work. Jobs of all sorts, such as laborers, would pick them up and offer them work. Third, we would be able to advance more in the field of Science and Technology, by experimenting on select arrested Church officials. This would help us improve Filipino students' education on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) courses. It will help us catch up to the standards of first-world countries in Scientific Advancements.

<p style="font-family:'Open Sans Condensed',sans-serif;font-size: 400 px; letter-spacing:inherit;"> <img src="http://boholchronicle.com.ph/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cartoon-editorial.jpg" alt="It weighs on the conscience of the voters when it comes to elections in the Philippines." style="float:right;">           This proposal is a necessity in the Filipino sociopolitical system today, because of the corrupt members of the Roman Catholic Church here in the Philippines. It's intention is to weed out the unscrupulous and the venal members of the Church. It of means to segregate the innocent and of no right of a bad reputation, and the immoral members that deserve every consequence brought upon by this proposal. It is of means to make the public aware and attentive of what is happening with the Catholic Church. And finally, it is for the good of the public, to not be manipulated and subjected to the hypocritical laws of the Church. It is for the good of the public to not be influenced by the dishonorable clergymen of the Church. </p>

<p style="font-family:'Open Sans Condensed',sans-serif;font-size: 400 px; letter-spacing:inherit;">           In Biblical times, Jesus challenged the scribes and the pharisees, who were the figures of authority of their religion. He exposed their hypocrisy and accused them of being wolves in sheep's clothing. Jesus proposed radical changes on how people ought to behave. To remove hypocrisy, we ought to be men and women of integrity; men and women who seek the untarnished truth. </p>
